# Project Reflection

## Problem Statement
The primary problem tackled in these projects was understanding real time memory management and utlizing the fastest solution.

## Approach to Solving the Problem
In approaching this challenge, I carefully selected data structures and algorithms that optimized performance and memory usage. Data structures are essential in organizing, accessing, and managing data efficiently. For example, I utilized a Binary Tree to ensure quick data retrieval and organized data storage. This choice not only made the programs efficient but also demonstrated the importance of a solid understanding of data structure fundamentals in crafting effective solutions.

## Overcoming Roadblocks
While implementing the insertNode function, an issue arose where newly added courses were not being correctly placed in the binary search tree. This misplacement often occurred due to a minor comparison error in the insertion logic.
Iterative Testing: I ran multiple tests with different courseId inputs to confirm the function worked as intended after the fix.
This process underscored the importance of precision in recursive structures and improved my debugging skills by isolating and resolving specific logic issues. ​

## Expanded Approach to Software Design
Working on this project has significantly expanded my approach to designing software. I now place a greater emphasis on structuring code to be scalable and maintainable. From planning early to include modular components to utilizing object-oriented programming for clean code separation, I have developed a broader view of software architecture. This includes anticipating potential future needs and designing systems that can adapt to changing requirements with minimal adjustments.

## Evolution in Writing Maintainable, Readable, and Adaptable Code
My coding style has evolved substantially through this project. I now prioritize clear, consistent naming conventions, detailed comments, and documentation to enhance readability. I also incorporated modular design and reusable functions, which has made my code more adaptable to new features or future changes. This project emphasized that writing maintainable code goes beyond functionality; it’s about creating code that other developers (or future me) can easily understand, work with, and extend.

## Summary
These reflections have underscored the value of systematic problem-solving, resilience, and adaptability in software development. This project has not only strengthened my technical skills but also my strategic approach to code structure, readability, and design. I look forward to using these insights in future projects and continuously refining my approach as I grow in my software development career.
